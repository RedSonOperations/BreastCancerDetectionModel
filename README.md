# BreastCancerDetectionModel
This project centers on the development of a sophisticated binary classifier using PyTorch, a robust deep learning framework. The primary objective is to create an advanced machine learning model capable of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast cancer cases based on a variety of input features derived from medical data.
Key Objectives: Feature Engineering, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Model Development: Leveraging PyTorch's capabilities, the project will involve the creation of a binary classification model adept at analyzing medical data related to breast cancer. Feature engineering techniques will be employed to extract crucial patterns and characteristics from the dataset.
Optimization for High Accuracy and Sensitivity: The model will be optimized to achieve high accuracy while ensuring sensitivity to detect malignant cases accurately, thus reducing false negatives.
Interpretability and Performance Metrics: Emphasis will be placed on model interpretability, facilitating comprehension of its decision-making process. Scored 98.5% test accuracy, 94.5% training accuracy and quite low testing/training loss (<0.08/<0.15) with a relatively small training batch/number of epochs through experimentation with linear layers, number of neurons in hidden layers, and learning rate.
Significance and Impact: Early Detection and Patient Outcomes: The project's core aim is to contribute to early breast cancer detection, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes through timely intervention and treatment.
